# Pocket Potentiostat
IEEE DeCal HOPE Final Project -- Potentiostat for applying cyclic voltammetry to electrolyte


- Blocks A, B, D, and E: uses OPA2277 high-precision operational amplifiers
- Block C: uses TL074 transimpedance amplifier
- Blocks F, G, and H: uses INA128 instrumentational amplifiers
- Block C uses a TL074 Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA). It is cost-effective, but it is not the best option (a really good one would be ~$40)
- May need to fix Rg resistor values based on how much the voltage in the electrodes varies
